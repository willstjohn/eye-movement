# Eye Tracking Exercise

## Description
This project was forked from an MIT exercise.
This project utlizes events such as `onmousemove` to create a pair of eyes that follow the cursor.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine and unzip the folder.
2. Open a new window in your browser and drag the `index.html` file onto it.
3. Watch as the eyes follow your cursor around the page.

## Roadmap
In the future, I would like to add some shading or maybe even some ominous blinking eyelids.
